## PR # 1209

kubecfg -c option should let me specify a URL

### Why

The kubecfg -c option is used to pass a file pointer to a representation of a model object on disk (pod, replicationController, service) for use by the operation.

It would be nice if I could do the following:

$ kubecfg -c "http://kubernetes-tutorials.com/tutorial1/pod.json"
$ kubecfg -c "http://mybuild-server.com/replicationController.json"
Where kubecfg sees the http:// and does a network operation to fetch resource for me.

This would let users who want to build tutorials on how to use kubernetes to avoid steps to manually download the files locally via curl and unzip, etc. and would also let scripters that use the kubecfg client to avoid needing write access on the terminal where they run kubecfg to perform basic actions.
